		The skill test doesn't stop there,
		you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
		Evalaution result of provided strings are (a+(b*c)).
	 
		So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.		
		Total galxies in picture are 3. 
	
		this is just check your stack handling skills.  so i hope you will pass  this test also
		so keep going . So, now I am  tried of this thing.  I think that's enough.

                Show your Coding skills and Dont use any built-in function for handling character array
		Read the below algorithm
 	        Steps to Convert Postfix to Infix :
		Read the symbol from the input .based on the input symbol go to step 2 or 3.
		If symbol is operand then push it into stack.
		If symbol is operator then pop top 2 values from the stack.
		this 2 popped value is our operand .
		create a new string and put the operator between this operand in string.
		push this string into stack.
		At the end only one value remain in stack which is our infix expression.

		Input the the expression to convert it into Infix form INVALID EXPRESSION and INVALID EXPRESSION. 
		
		Wait you have to do one more task to complete this assignment
		you have to evaluate on more statement to prove your  skills on basic stack working. 
		Show the result if the given string after evaluation INVALID EXPRESSION. Oh again INVALID EXPRESSION
	 
		Did you miss assignment 1?. Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture. ):

		Do you remember the questions in our school exams where we evaluated an infix, postfix or prefix expression?
		The only thing we could wish for then is a computer program that would directly give us the answer on entering the expression as input. 
		Well, guess what?
		A common question in the coding rounds of interviews is to write a program for “Expression evaluation using Stack”. 
		In this article, we will learn how to solve that question.
                The file getting processed and the converted Infix notations are AB+C*D/E- and +A-/B*C+DCF and mn*pq-+r+ SYNTAX ERROR .
		One more statement to test your coding skills to handle the character arrya without using any builtin funciton, 
		so show this expression in to Infix form INVALID EXPRESSION and INVALID EXPRESSION. 
		
                  To begin with, let us see how infix expression evaluation using stack.  INVALID EXPRESSION.
	 
		So,you said you enjoyed the previous assignment and learned much and more :). Now, tell me the about the number of galxies in the picture.
